#ssh is a seure shell protocol.
#ssh protocol is used to encrypted connection between two hosts
#ssh runs tcp/ip port 22
#syntax
 
   ssh username@ip address

two type of authentication is there:
1.key based authentication
2.password based authentication

#Using public-private key pair to login into remote server is more secure as compare to passwords

#ssh is more secure than other protocol such as telnet because encryption of data

#three major encryption techniques used by ssh
1)symmetrical 
2)asymmetrical
3)hashing

#asymmetrical method is more secure it generates two different key pairs

#public_key (id_rsa.pub)
A public key is distributed to anyone 
public key is copied to remote machine then using ssh keys secure connection will be established(Encryption function)

#private_key(id_rsa)
private key kept secret on client machine(Decryption function)

#rsa dsa is a encryption  algoritham

#password less authentication commands
#Create new public-private key pairs
   1)ssh-keygen -t rsa
#2)public key is copied to remote server
   2)ssh-copy-id RemoteUserName@Ipaddress
#public key is copied to remote server on authorized_keys file

#After using
    3)ssh dhana@192.168.1.1 
#the secure encrypted connection will be established


#Disable SSH Password based authentication
#It is an extra layer security of our server 
#Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to change the following options
  1)passwordAuthentication no
  2)ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
  3)UsePAM no

#Then restart the SSH Service
#sudo systemctl restart ssh
